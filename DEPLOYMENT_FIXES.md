**Location**: Deploy Bundle step in GitHub Actions workflow

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issues:**

1. **PATH Persistence Problem** ⚠️
   - Each step in GitHub Actions runs in a **separate shell session**
   - `export PATH` only affects the current step
   - Subsequent steps don't inherit the modified PATH
   - Solution: Use `$GITHUB_PATH` to persist environment variables

2. **Wrong Databricks CLI Package** ⚠️
   - You installed `databricks` (unified CLI) via `pip install --user databricks`
   - But configured it like the legacy `databricks-cli` package
   - DAB (Databricks Asset Bundles) requires the **unified Databricks CLI**
   - The unified CLI should be installed via official installation script, not pip

3. **Incorrect Authentication Method** ⚠️
   - Used manual JSON config file: `~/.databricks/config`
   - This is for the **legacy CLI**, not the unified CLI
   - DAB requires proper authentication via `databricks configure --token`

4. **Missing Validation Step** ⚠️
   - No bundle validation before deployment
   - Could deploy broken configurations
   - Best practice: Always validate before deploying

---

## ✅ Applied Fixes

### **1. Proper Databricks CLI Installation**

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Install Databricks CLI
  run: |
    pip uninstall -y databricks-cli || true
    pip install --user databricks
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # ❌ Doesn't persist
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Install Databricks CLI
  run: |
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh
    echo "$HOME/.databrickscli" >> $GITHUB_PATH  # ✅ Persists across steps
```

**Why This Works:**
- Uses official Databricks installation script
- Installs unified CLI correctly
- Adds to `$GITHUB_PATH` which persists across all subsequent steps

---

### **2. Correct Authentication for DAB**

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Configure Databricks CLI
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.databricks
    echo '{"host": "'$DATABRICKS_HOST'", "token": "'$DATABRICKS_TOKEN'"}' > ~/.databricks/config
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Configure Databricks Authentication
  run: |
    databricks configure --token <<EOF
    ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_HOST }}
    ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_TOKEN }}
    EOF
```

**Why This Works:**
- Uses the correct authentication method for unified CLI
- Properly configured for DAB operations
- Follows Databricks best practices

---

### **3. Added Bundle Validation**

**New Step:**
```yaml
- name: Validate Bundle Configuration
  run: databricks bundle validate -t dev_feature
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches configuration errors before deployment
- Validates permissions and resource access
- Ensures bundle syntax is correct
- Fails fast if there are issues

---

### **4. Removed Redundant PATH Exports**

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Deploy Bundle
  run: |
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # ❌ Unnecessary, doesn't work
    databricks bundle deploy -t dev_feature
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Deploy Bundle
  run: databricks bundle deploy -t dev_feature  # ✅ Clean, works
```

**Why This Works:**
- PATH was already set globally via `$GITHUB_PATH`
- No need for per-step exports
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

---

### **5. Improved `databricks.yml` Structure**

**Key Changes:**
- Added proper `mode: development` for dev environments
- Configured `artifacts` section for wheel building
- Specified cluster configuration explicitly
- Removed deprecated `environments` configuration
- Fixed wheel path references

**Before:**
```yaml
targets:
  dev_feature:
    workspace:
      root_path: "/Shared/dbx/projects/data-pipeline_dev_feature_v2"
      artifact_path: "/Volumes/data_lake_dev/feature_artifacts/databricks_store"
    resources:
      jobs:
        data_pipeline-rep-smoke-dev-feature-val-v1:
          tasks:
            - task_key: "rep_dev_feature_validation_task"
              python_wheel_task:
                package_name: "data_pipeline"
                entry_point: "data-pipeline-etl"
                parameters: [...]
              environment_key: "default"  # ❌ Deprecated
          environments:  # ❌ Wrong location
            - environment_key: "default"
              spec:
                client: "1"
                dependencies: [...]
```

**After:**
```yaml
targets:
  dev_feature:
    mode: development  # ✅ Proper mode
    workspace:
      root_path: "/Shared/dbx/projects/data-pipeline_dev_feature_v2"
    
    artifacts:  # ✅ Correct artifacts section
      default:
        type: whl
        build: python setup.py bdist_wheel
        path: ./dist/*.whl
    
    resources:
      jobs:
        data_pipeline-rep-smoke-dev-feature-val-v1:
          name: "data_pipeline-rep-smoke-dev-feature-val-v1"
          tasks:
            - task_key: "rep_dev_feature_validation_task"
              new_cluster:  # ✅ Explicit cluster config
                spark_version: "13.3.x-scala2.12"
                node_type_id: "Standard_DS3_v2"
                num_workers: 1
              python_wheel_task:
                package_name: "data_pipeline"
                entry_point: "data-pipeline-etl"
                parameters: [...]
              libraries:  # ✅ Correct location for dependencies
                - whl: ../dist/*.whl
```
